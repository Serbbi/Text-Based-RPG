# Text Based RPG

## Introduction
This, as the title entitles, is an RPG type game which can be played in the console. It was developed by [Andrew Rutherfoord](https://github.com/AndrewRutherfoord)
and [Serban Tonie](https://github.com/Serbbi) as a project for the course `Object Oriented Programming` at the University of Groningen. 
The project was for us to get a better understanding of the concepts of OOP taught in the lectures and to apply them in a practical way.
This RPG was made in `Java` and uses the `Maven` build tool.

For a better understanding of the project, please read the [README](rpg/README.md) in the `rpg` directory where you can find
all the details about the requirements that we needed to implement.

## Program Description

Here is a quick description of the program. There is a player which is controlled by the user, and you can tell the player to 
move around in different rooms in the dungeon. The player can also interact with NPCs, acquire weapons and other useful items
in their adventure to conquer the dungeon. You can save and load your progress in the game at any time. The goal of the game
is to slay all 3 bosses hidden in the dungeon. Although getting to them requires a lot of battling weaker enemies till the player 
is strong enough to face the bosses. There are some good NPCs that will also give you quests or better weapons, so keep an 
eye out for them.
